# 📝 Home Inventory System – Cline's Reference Notes

## 🎯 Project Goal
Build a self-hosted, test-driven, extensible Home Inventory System using Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy.  
Deployable on Synology via Docker.  
Future-proof for photos, barcodes, and mobile access.  
Designed for non-tech users (Sam) and future-you (Alex).

## 🧠 Core Personas (Always Keep in Mind)
- **Alex (You)**: Wants testable, modular, Docker-ready code. No tech debt. Builds for *future you*.
- **Sam (User)**: Non-technical. Just wants to know what’s in the pantry. Needs simple, visual, no-login access.
- **Cline (AI Partner)**: TDD-first, step-by-step, explains why, never skips tests, keeps it simple.

## 🛠️ Development Rules (Cline Must Follow)
1. **Always write tests before code** (TDD).
2. **Break tasks into small, testable steps**.
3. **Never add features not in scope** (e.g., auth, UI, complex logic).
4. **Use SQLite for simplicity** (not PostgreSQL).
5. **Include Dockerfile, requirements.txt, .env, README.md** with setup steps.
6. **Explain concepts gently** — no jargon without analogy.
7. **Check in on personas** before writing code:
   - “Would Sam understand this?”
   - “Would future Alex be proud of this?”

```
## 🔍 Current Task
- ✅ Write `tests/test_models.py` with a failing test for `Item` model
- ✅ (Test file created - will fail because Item model doesn't exist yet)
- ✅ Then create `backend/models.py` to make it pass
- ✅ (Model implemented and test passes)
- ✅ Then write `backend/schemas.py` for data validation
- ✅ Then create `backend/database.py` for connection
- ✅ Then build `main.py` and `api/items.py`
- ✅ Then write `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`
- ➡️ Next: Update the project to include more comprehensive models (House, Room, Location, Container)
```
## 🧩 Future Features (Keep in Mind, But Don’t Implement Yet)
- [ ] Add expiry date display
- [ ] Add photo upload (future: via API)
- [ ] Add barcode scanning (future: via mobile app)
- [ ] Add web UI (future: with React or simple HTML)

## 🔄 Session Notes
- Session 1: Project started. Created file structure.
- Session 2: Started TDD — test for `Item` model pending.
- Session 3: Will write test → then model → then schema → then API.

## ✅ Next Step (Cline Should Do)
> "Let’s write a failing test for the `Item` model in `tests/test_models.py`."
```

## 🧠 How to Use It with Cline

### ✅ **Before Starting a New Session**
Just say:
> “Use the `notes.md` file to guide our next step.”

Cline will:
- Read the current status
- Know what’s done
- Know what’s next
- Stay on task
- Not repeat itself

### ✅ **After Any Step**
You can say:
> “Update `notes.md` with what we just did.”

Cline will:
- Add a new bullet point
- Mark files as done
- Update the task list
- Keep the file alive

### ✅ **When You’re Lost**
Say:
> “What’s the next step according to `notes.md`?”

Cline will:
> “The next step is to write `tests/test_models.py` with a failing test for `Item`.”

---

## 🌟 Bonus: Make `notes.md` Your Project Bible

Over time, this file becomes:
- Your **project memory**
- Cline’s **shared context**
- A **record of decisions**
- A **checkpoint for progress**

And when you come back in 3 months?
> “Let’s continue where we left off.”  
> ✅ Cline checks `notes.md` — and knows exactly what to do.

---

## 🚀 Final Step: Save It

1. Create the file:
   ```bash
   touch notes.md
   ```
2. Paste the content above.
3. Commit it to Git (if you’re using version control):
   ```bash
   git add notes.md
   git commit -m "Add project reference notes for Cline"
   ```

---

## ✅ Summary: Why This Works

| Problem | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Cline forgets context | `notes.md` is its memory |
| You repeat instructions | Just say “use notes.md” |
| Tasks get lost | Clear task list with status |
| Scope creep | Future features are noted but not built |
| No progress tracking | Each session updates the file |

---

> 🎯 **Now you’re not just building software.**  
> You’re building a **system of collaboration** — with Cline as your co-pilot, your reminder, your guide.

Save `notes.md` now — and never explain the same thing twice.

You’ve got this. 🚀
